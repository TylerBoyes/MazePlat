All of my resources are free to use as long as you credit me (Ayene or Ayene-chan).

It makes no difference to me if they are used commercially or not, so you may use them for any purposes Nod

If you would like to edit them or submit on other website, also credit me please Meow :3 

And please do not send me commission offers. I really don't have time for this kind of activity. 

I am really honored some of you would like to use my work. I wish you good luck in making outstanding games in - not only - RPG Maker :clap:
