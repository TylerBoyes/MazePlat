Hey guys. I wanted to release this big batch of unused art I've made of the years. There is a lot here, and it's a bit disorganized. This is for anyone to use for anything you want. Keep in mind, this is 1 part of 5 so check my account for the other 4 pieces of this massive set.
You don't have to ask me to use them. Just give me credit please, I don't need or even want to be a co-creator to your game or anything. That glory is all for you! Just link to me if you run ads. I appreciate it!
If you release the game, please give me a percentage of the ad revenue you make here on NG. If you're releasing the game elsewhere, don't worry about it then. I know this is a shot in the dark but alternatively if you're feeling charitable you can also just donate any loose change you have to Hyptosis@gmail.com on paypal.
I'm going to try to release more of this kind of thing in the future, especially if it helps anyone out. Let me know if you use them!
